"""
This program allows a user three tries to guess the correct answer to teh question 
question = "what is teh captital of california". The answer is "Sacramentor"/ 

We first set max_tries = 3. then we create a loop to iterate three times. for each iteration, 
we ask the user for the anwser (user input).  Then based on the anwser the user gives, 
we check to see if the user input matches the answer. If so, print "Correct", then terminate the loop with a break statement. 

If the user could not guess the correct answer within the max_tries, then print 
"You have uded up your allotment of guesses.", then print  "The correct answer is 'California'".
